 Overview 
We’re excited to see your full-stack skills, mainly frontend in action! For this assignment, 
your task is to recreate a simplified version of a product landing page inspired by 
Apple’s iPhone 16 Pro page. It should NOT be a pixel-perfect replica, the goal is to 
demonstrate your ability to build an elegant, interactive, and responsive frontend 
experience using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and optionally Shadcn UI or any other useful 
UI/animation libraries. 
 
Problem Statement 
Create a product-focused landing page for a fictional tech product (feel free to name it 
creatively) that captures the spirit and feel of Apple’s product pages. Your version should: 
 
 Must-Have Requirements: 
 Design & Layout 
●​ Use Next.js (App Router preferred) and Tailwind CSS for structure and styling.​
 
●​ Keep the design clean, modern, and responsive across all devices.​
 
●​ Implement scroll-based animations (e.g., fade-ins, parallax sections, smooth 
transitions).​
 
●​ Use beautiful typography and spacing inspired by minimalistic design principles.​
 
 Interactivity & UX 
●​ Add subtle hover effects and micro-interactions to bring the UI to life.​
 
●​ Implement a page loader (on initial load) that smoothly transitions to the main 
content.​
 
●​ Include at least one interactive component (product color selector, feature slider).​
 
🔧 Technical Features 
●​ Use client-side state management (can be React's built-in state or context, no 
Redux needed).​
 
●​ Use dynamic routes and layouts in Next.js where applicable.​
 
●​ Follow best practices for folder structure, naming, component reusability, and 
responsiveness.​
 
 Optional Nice-to-Haves 
●​ Use Shadcn UI for certain components like buttons or modals if it improves your 
workflow.​
 
●​ Add form validation for a fake email subscription input (no backend needed).​
 
●​ Light usage of libraries like Framer Motion, GSAP, or Locomotive Scroll is 
welcome.​
 
 
 Submission Guidelines: 
●​ Host the project on GitHub and share the live demo link (e.g., Vercel/Netlify).​
 
●​ Write a short README explaining your decisions (e.g., animation tools used, 
structure, libraries).​
 
●​ Deadline: 2 days from assignment received.​
 
 
What We’re Evaluating 
●​ Your ability to build smooth, beautiful UIs using modern tools.​
 
●​ Attention to detail in animations and interactions.​
 
●​ Code quality, structure, and how you manage component/state complexity.​
 
●​ Thoughtfulness in choosing tools and balancing simplicity with flair.​
 
 
This assignment is not about backend—you may skip database or API integration unless 
you want to showcase something extra.
